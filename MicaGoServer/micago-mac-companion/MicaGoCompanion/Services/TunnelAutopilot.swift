// C18: the ONLY link between server health and the optional Remote Tunnel.
//
// Ownership model: the backend owns its own lifecycle and never waits on,
// checks, or starts the tunnel. The tunnel optionally FOLLOWS backend health
// when the user enabled "start/stop tunnel with server". This file is the
// entire coupling, as a pure function — no Foundation, no process spawns, no
// main-actor state — so the decoupling is unit-testable in isolation.
//
// Decisions fire only on health *transitions* (healthy↔unhealthy), never on
// every poll tick: a steady state can't repeatedly retry a failed tunnel, and
// the very first poll after launch (previousHealthy == nil) may start an
// opted-in tunnel but never stops one it didn't see healthy first.
